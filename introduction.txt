A variety of attendance monitoring systems are employed in schools, colleges
and organizations. In schools and colleges, the attendance of each student
is taken manually by the teacher. The teacher notes down roll numbers of
students present for that class and updates it on to the website later. On
an average 5-10 minutes are spent in taking attendance of each class. The
above steps are to be carried out by each teacher for every class he/she
engages. The attendance data of students is not updated onto the website
everyday but, once in a week or in a fortnight.
In various organizations, automated attendance systems are used which
are based on electronic tags, barcode badges, magnetic stripe cards, biomet-
rics etc. These systems are static and are mount at specic places. Every
individual has to approach the module to cast his attendance. Thus, these
systems cannot be employed in schools and colleges as they involve taking
attendance of a large number of students on an hourly basis.
We aim to address the issues in existing attendance monitoring system
by designing Smart Attendance System. It is a portable biometrics based
attendance system which updates the attendance directly onto the website
without teacher0s intervention.
