1. Matching the attendance data against timetable. Not allowing the
    teacher to update attendance data later on (out of class hours)
2. Generating attendance reports for both studnets and teachers.
3. Generating a timetable based on attendance report :P... what time is maximum 
    attendance seen for each class.
