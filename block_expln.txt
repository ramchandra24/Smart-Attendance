Smart Attendance System consists of two parts
1. Handheld device or client.
2. Server.

A typical usecase of Smart Attendance System is shown in fig. 

Handheld device consists of a fingerprint module for student identication, a microcontroller and a Zigbee transmitter. Fingerprint of each student is stored on the module initially. This phase is called 'Enrollment' wherein each student is assigned a unique ID, analogous to Roll number, which will be later used for identification. 

At the receiver end, xbee
module receives the data sent by the transmitter and sends it serially to the
server computer. A 0C0 program is written on the server which monitors
this serial port and reads data from the port. The data packet received
contains information about the students present in the class. This data is
used to generate MySQL queries to fetch the attendance data corresponding
to those students and update their attendance in the database. Once the
attendance data is updated on the server, it is instantaneously re
ected on the website.
