Smart Attendance System comprises of:
1. Multiple Handheld devices 
2. Gateway device
3. Server

A typical usecase of Smart Attendance System is shown in fig. 
Handheld devices are used in different classrooms and a single server is used in a school/college environment as shown in the fig. 

Each handheld device is made up of a fingerprint module, a microcontroller and a Zigbee transceiver. 
The fingerprint module is a biometric device used for student identification. It comes with a storage to save user's fingerprints and an on board processor to identify them later on. 
Depending on the size of class, modules of different capacity can be used.  The fingerprint module attaches a unique ID for each fingerprint stored and on identification returns the same ID.
The fingerprint module sends the ID of user on a serial interface. A microcontroller connected to it reads the ID, interprets it and forwards it to the gateway device via Zigbee interface.


The fingerprint module and the zigbee device are both interfaced to the microcontroller. The microcontroller recieves
information from the fingerprint module, interprets it and then intelligently transmits the required data to the gateway device.


A zigbee device(coordinator) at the server end acts as a gateway between the zigbee network and the Server, providing the data
from the remote handheld devices into a serial interface received by the server. 


Server/PC receives attendance information from the gateway device and updates it into a central database.


Working :
Handheld device consists of a fingerprint module - for student identication, a microcontroller and a Zigbee transmitter. Fingerprint of each student is stored on the module initially. This phase is called 'Enrollment' wherein each student is assigned a unique ID, analogous to Roll number, which will be later used for identification.
