Smart Attendance System consists of two parts
1. Handheld device or client.
2. Server.
Handheld device consists of a ngerprint module used for person identi-
cation. Fingerprints of students are stored on the module initially and
each student is assigned an ID ( Roll number ) for identication. These
identiers, corresponding to students present in the class are sent to mi-
crocontroller serially. Microcontroller adds the header information to the
data received. The header includes information about the class in progress,
subject, teacher etc. This data is sent to the xbee module serially and it is
then transmitted wirelessly to the receiver. At the receiver end, xbee
module receives the data sent by the transmitter and sends it serially to the
server computer. A 0C0 program is written on the server which monitors
this serial port and reads data from the port. The data packet received
contains information about the students present in the class. This data is
used to generate MySQL queries to fetch the attendance data corresponding
to those students and update their attendance in the database. Once the
attendance data is updated on the server, it is instantaneously re
ected on the website.
