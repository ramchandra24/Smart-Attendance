1. If we want to send the roll-numbers of students who are absent everytime, 
each module has to know the roll-numbers of students registered for every subject. 
Or, there has to be an ACK mechanism which indicates when a particular student 
has not registered for the course.
Ex: only a few students have taken a course. How to update attendance properly ?
    even when present data is sent, students who have not registered will be updated
    as absent by the system.

2. What is the maximum size of each transmission ?
