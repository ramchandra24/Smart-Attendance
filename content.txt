Abstract 

Internet has been entering into every aspect of today0s life. Every
device is becoming smart by staying connected to the internet. At-
tendance monitoring is one area where the usage of smart devices is
limited. In today0s busy life, parents are not able to track the day-
to-day activities of their children, they are not even aware of whether
their children are attending their classes regularly. Attendance plays
a very important role in modern education system. To ensure that
students attend their classes on a regular basis, Educational institu-
tions are taking strict measures. But the existing systems have 
aws
in them, they are not 100 percent accurate, for example, the teachers
may fail to recognize any proxy attendances and it is also an overhead
on teacher to update the attendance on website. Taking attendance in
class as well as updating it onto the website are time consuming and
extra burden on teacher. If the attendance is not updated on time,
the parents are unaware of their ward0s status. This problem has been
overlooked for a long time.
