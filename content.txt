Abstract 

Internet has been entering into every aspect of today's life. Every
device is becoming smart by staying connected to the internet. At-
tendance monitoring is one area where the usage of smart devices is
limited. In today's busy life, parents are not able to track the day-
to-day activities of their children, they are not even aware of whether
their children are attending their classes regularly. Attendance plays
a very important role in modern education system. To ensure that
students attend their classes on a regular basis, Educational institu-
tions are taking strict measures. But the existing systems have 
flaws in them, they are not entirely accurate, for example, the Professor
may fail to recognize any proxy attendances and it is also an overhead
on the Professor to update the attendance on website. Taking attendance in
class as well as updating it onto the website is time consuming and
extra burden. If the attendance is not updated on time,
the parents are unaware of their ward's status. This problem has been
overlooked for a long time. The following paper aims to provide a novel solution to the problem.
